# We need public capacity in Artificial Intelligence for the public good.

## What Is Public AI?

- Public AI is **built by the public sector**: guaranteeing AI capacity is not limited to Big Tech.
- Public AI is **accessible**: ensuring that AI delivers benefits to all.
- Public AI is **accountable**: ensurin that AI reflects society's values.
- Public AI is being researched and built **right now** - all around the world.

## Why We Need It

- Limited public capacity in AI is stifling our ability to actively shape the direction of society
- AI will become permanent essential infrastructure like train tracks and water pipelines - we can't leave this to the private sector.
- AI systems are growing in power and must reflect society's values - not the interests of shareholders.
- The private sector has a head start - and without investment in public capacity it will be hard to catch up

## Who We Are

We are a coalition advocating for the creation of Public AI. Our aims are to:

- Make sure public capacity building is part of the conversation about AI
- Make it easier to build Public AI by coordinating research efforts in the ML community
- Support policymakers seeking to impelement Public AI
